MEDIapoyo offers an eco-friendly, AI-powered health assistant
designed to help students manage their health proactively,
reduce illness-related anxiety, and provide first-step basic
guidance while they await a professional diagnosis.
It's a solution developed during the days of MoroccoAI innovAI Hackathon.
Note: the ML models are not integrated with the project for the moment.
